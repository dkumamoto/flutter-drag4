# heavily modified project and should run as an app directly.

I've modified it so I can see the points selected as the touch is moved around. (rather than at the end).

I've also changed it so duplicate entries are allowed.

I also thought that squares would be better but circle allows diagonal movements (otherwise movements near the corners would go to one or other square left/right or top/bottom, not diagonal.


## original readme: (most of it was deleted)
